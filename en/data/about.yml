    title : Technologies is in our blood
    description : >
      We learn new technologies almost every day. We test them, we evaluate them, we understand them to see
      how they can fit their purpose. We choose carefully technologies we use to make sure we won't have to
      change them in the middle of a project and to ensure the robustness of our application.

    title : We think <application>
    description : >
      Integrating, distributing or scaling an application is how we think about it. We will evaluate all the 
      needs behind what we have to develop and how it is going to be used. We have built so many applications 
      that we master almost all the type of architecture an application can require.
      
      Let's start working togheter at building your next technology.
